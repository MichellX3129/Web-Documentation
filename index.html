			<h2>Phone and Mobile display design</h2>
			<p>The phone and mobile display is considered.</p>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
      <p>First, a mood board is utilised to create a overall visual aesthetic, and inspiration regarding efficient mobile website layout is considered. </p>
      <figure>
		<img src="Moodboard.jpg" alt="Moodboard"
        width="100%">
        <figcaption>Moodboard
        </figcaption>
</figure>
			<p>Within this moodboard, I allocated the specific colour palette that I will be following in the overal web design, both on laptop screens and mobile screens.
      </p>
      <p>With the mobile web layout examples within in the moodboard, it can be seen that moble website layout that follows a minimalist and streamlined display. Because with the mobile screen, the user will be looking at the same amount of information, but however on a smaller screen. The examples within the moodboards displayed layouts that both demonstrate a clean display and format for the information they layed out.</p>
      <p>I think for my further development of the site and it's mobile layout, it will follow more of a minimalistic look. As I think this would be better to further communicate informations to the users.</p>

			<h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
			<p>At this stage, I initally did a few sketches regarding the look and wireframe of the mobile layout</p>
      <p>First I brainstormed a few idea by doing quick sketches. </p>
       <figure>
		<img src="Sketches1.jpg" alt="Sketch1"
        width="100%">
        <figcaption>Quick Sketches
        </figcaption>
</figure>
      <p>
        In the 6 quick sketches I did for the mobile layout. I recognises that the main issue in creating a clean and visually informative layout regards around the nav bar's design.  
      </p>
      <figure>
      <img src= "Sketches2.jpg" alt="Annotate Sketch1" width="100%">
      <figcaption>Ideation 1
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p> 
        I realised that having a full nav bar both horizonally or have it down the side took up too much space within the layout. As well it would make the overall layout appear more busy and wordy. So I think it is best to have the nav bar compress into a hamburger like the examples and inspirations in the moodboard. Having a hamburger bar, the overall layour look nicer and cleaner. 
      </p>
      <figure>
      <img src= "Sketches3.jpg" alt="Annotate Sketch2" width="100%">
      <figcaption>Ideation 2
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>With the users identified in the proposal, it is reconigesed that the users are people who are busy with their jobs and studies. So I think it would be better if for the mobile layout, most of the call to action and information are presented in the first screen, so they would need need to scroll around to find more informaiton. </p>
		<p> 
      I decided to adopt more of a block display, in the likeness of the inspired layouts within the moodboard. So having each element takes up a part sections of the screen to space out and evenly distributed throughout the screens. 
		</p>
		</section>
		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Change in Design.</h2>
			<p>I decided to take out the inital "events" "goals" and "history" cards that are in the original layout. I felt like it is a repetition of infromation presented. As the Goals of the charity are clearly described in the text above the cards. And the history of the company should be catagorised and put under the "About Us" tab. And not its own charagory. </p>
		</section>
			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      
			<p>The wireframe of both the mobile layout and the website are created.</p>
		 <figure>
		<img src="Phone wire frame.jpg" alt="Wireframe 1"
        width="100%">
        <figcaption>Wireframe 1
        </figcaption>
		 </figure>
     	 <figure>
		<img src="Wireframe web.jpg" alt="Wireframe 2"
        width="100%">
        <figcaption>Wireframe 2
        </figcaption>
		 </figure>
      <h3 id="finalchanges"> Final Changes </h3>
      <p>Following feed back from the previous proposal, I have decided to shift around colours of the final website so it would have a better visual communication. I have made the colors of the call of actions buttons i.e. the Donate and volunteer buttons a lot more brighter than the secondary, Learn more button. </p>
      <p> I also introduced more of an interactive elements to the website with the hover function. If the user hover over the logos of the 2 departments of the charity, it would reveal image of the community having fun and being happy alongs side of the call the action buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through that hover funciton, I wish to communitcate to the user that: <strong> Although the charity seems more serious on the outside, when they join and participate with the charity, they will be introduced and welcomed into a big community. </strong>
