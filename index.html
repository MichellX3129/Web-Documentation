			<h2>Phone and Mobile display design</h2>
			<p>The phone and mobile display is considered.</p>
			<h3 id="moodboards">Mood Boards</h3>
      <p>First, a mood board is utilised to create a overall visual aesthetic, and inspiration regarding efficient mobile website layout is considered. </p>

			<p>Rem iste iure blanditiis excepturi esse nisi corrupti sequi, illo, laborum quo quis quaerat assumenda perspiciatis
				quod fuga vel laudantium doloribus architecto tempora omnis earum!</p>

		<section id="designs">
			<h2>Designs</h2>
			<p>First a critical look at the existing website was take. The existing website has <strong>a lack of information displayed</strong>. The landing page is <strong>short</strong>, in order to obtain key information’s such as how to help, key insights and goals are <strong>not immediately apparent</strong> in the landing page.</p>
        <figure>
		<img src="Critic.jpg" alt="Critical Analysis"
        width="100%">
        <figcaption>Analysis of current webpage
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Therefore the design goal is to imporve on those aspects as well as to affirm to the user needs listed on the User profiles.</p>

	<h3>Sketches</h3>
  <figure>
		<img src="Sketch1.jpg" alt="Sketch1"
        width="100%">
        <figcaption>Wireframe Sketch 1
        </figcaption>
</figure>
  <p>In the first stage of sketching, the navigation bar is place all the way at the top of the webpage. And the large strip of image will draw attention along side with the <em>Donate</em>prompt. Both logos are listed allows the user to understand the 2 departments of the charity.</p>

   <figure>
		<img src="Sketch2.jpg" alt="Sketch2"
        width="100%">
        <figcaption>Wireframe Sketch 2
        </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In this second ideation of sketching, more emphasis is place on the <strong> 2 departments </strong>. They would have 2 different call the action prompts on on each side. Emphaising <strong>composition </strong> of the organisation's structure. 300 Blankets being predominatly function by <strong>donations</strong> to fund the supply destribution and the Soul Kitchen being more <strong>community/volunteering </strong> oriented. Having the 2 main ways for sustainability outlined at the top enabled the user to see it immedaitely. Following it, <strong? the ideology and philiosphy</strong> would be oulined as well as the chartity's introduction videos, allowing the user understand <strong>key insights</strong> of the organisation. </p>
<p>The other main emphasis of the this sketch proposed website is the introduction of the <strong>community</strong> of the charity. This would enable the user to click into the other links to learn more about the overall community.</p>

			<h3 id="wireframes">Wireframes</h3>
      
			<p>This is the wireframe of the sketch 2 for the proposed site. I aime to add more information to onto the landing page whilst having a clearer and more minimal navigation bar and layout.</p>

        </figcaption>
		 </figure>
      <h3 id="mockups">Mockups</h3>
      <p>Through utilising ideas generated from the moodboard and wireframe. I am able to generate the proposed website's pages through Adobe XD.</p>
